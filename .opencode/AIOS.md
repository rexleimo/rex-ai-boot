<!-- AIOS NATIVE BEGIN -->
AIOS native enhancements are active in this repository.

Use repo-local skills, agents, and bootstrap docs before falling back to ad-hoc behavior.


## AIOS Self-Trigger Routing

- Continue normally in the active coding client for single-domain work.
- If the user asks for delegation, parallel work, or 2+ clearly independent domains, trigger AIOS directly instead of asking the user to run it manually: `aios team ...` or `node <AIOS_ROOT>/scripts/ctx-agent.mjs --route team|subagent ...`.
- If the user asks for a long-running, overnight, resumable, checkpoint-heavy objective, trigger the solo harness directly: `aios harness run --objective "<task>" --worktree --max-iterations 8`.
- Use `aios harness status --session <id>`, `aios hud --session <id>`, `aios harness stop --session <id> --reason "<why>"`, and `aios harness resume --session <id>` for handoff and recovery.
- Do not ask the user to manually trigger AIOS commands unless they requested dry-run/preview or the environment lacks permission to run shell commands.

## Privacy & Relay Safety

- Before sending context to any model or relay service, assume prompts, code snippets, diffs, logs, screenshots, MCP output, and browser-extracted text may leave this machine.
- Never paste or expose API keys, tokens, cookies, sessions, private keys, `.env` files, credential configs, customer data, browser profiles, or unredacted authorization logs.
- For sensitive files, use `aios privacy read --file <path>` and share only the redacted output.
- If a custom model endpoint or relay is detected, warn the user before continuing and avoid sending secrets or proprietary data.
- LLM privacy instructions are advisory; do not claim strict privacy compliance unless deterministic AIOS gates verified the relevant checks.

ContextDB remains the shared runtime layer for memory, checkpoints, and execution evidence.

Wrapped `codex` / `claude` / `gemini` / `opencode` sessions receive an AIOS startup route prompt. The agent should self-select `single`, `subagent`, `team`, or `harness` and run the matching AIOS command when the request warrants it.

Persona and user profile memory are part of the same runtime layer:
- `aios memo persona ...` manages the global agent identity file (`~/.aios/SOUL.md` by default).
- `aios memo user ...` manages the global operator preference file (`~/.aios/USER.md` by default).
- `ctx-agent` injects persona and user profile content into the Memory prelude before workspace memo content.
- Treat these files as stable guidance, not task facts; project-specific facts should still go through ContextDB events, checkpoints, or workspace memo.

Browser MCP is available through the repo-local AIOS server and should be preferred for browser work.

For browser tasks, use this operating pattern unless the user explicitly asks otherwise:
- Connect to a visible CDP browser first: `chrome.launch_cdp` then `browser.connect_cdp`.
- On dense or dynamic pages, prefer `page.semantic_snapshot` first for compact headings/actions before choosing the next step.
- Before acting, read the page state with `page.extract_text`; use `page.get_html` only when text is insufficient.
- Work in short read -> act -> verify loops. Do not chain multiple blind browser actions.
- For clear button/link labels, prefer `page.click_text` before constructing low-level locators.
- Prefer visible text or role-based targets. If a locator is not unique, inspect again and narrow the target instead of guessing.
- After navigation or major actions, use `page.wait` when a state transition is expected, then re-read the page.
- Use `page.screenshot` only as a visual fallback when text/HTML evidence is not enough.
- For complex browser tasks, first summarize the current page, then state the next single action, then execute it.
- When `puppeteer-stealth` is available, use its browser-use toolchain (`chrome.*` / `browser.*` / `page.*`) for normal business flows instead of `chrome-devtools`.

# AIOS For OpenCode

This repository provides compatibility-tier native enhancements for OpenCode through repo-local skills and AIOS runtime conventions.

## Agent Self-Trigger

When this client is launched through AIOS shell integration, continue normal single-agent work by default. For explicit delegation/parallel requests, run the injected `team` or `subagent` AIOS command. For long-running, overnight, resumable objectives, run `aios harness run --objective "<task>" --worktree --max-iterations 8` and use `aios harness status/resume/stop` for handoff.
