# Stop Debating AI Programming Tools in 2026 — Here's What Actually Works

Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI...

Are you still watching comparison videos and getting more confused?

Stop worrying. This article isn't about benchmarks or hype. I'll tell you **which tool to reach for in which scenario**, and **whether it's possible to have everything**.

---

## TL;DR (for impatient readers)

| Your situation | Recommended | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| Writing core business logic | Claude Code | Best context understanding, highest code quality |
| Running automation scripts / browser operations | Codex | Works out of the box, stable and reliable |
| Google ecosystem developer | Gemini | Seamless Workspace integration |
| **I want all of the above** | **RexCLI** | Integrates all three + extras |

If you're in a rush, skip to the last section.

## 01. Context Continuity (Resume from Breakpoint)

This is the dimension I think is **most overlooked but most important**.

### Claude Code: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Context retention is **the strongest**. I used it to refactor 2000 lines of legacy code with a 3-day gap in between. When I resumed, it remembered which function I was refactoring last.

`claude://` protocol is deeply integrated. File modification history is crystal clear.

### Codex: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Context is decent too, but cross-file tracking is slightly weaker than Claude. Good for medium-length tasks.

### Gemini: ⭐⭐⭐

Google's strength is search. Programming context is a bit lacking. Long tasks tend to "lose memory."

**My take**: If you're running long tasks (over 1 hour), go with Claude Code. If you're only running tasks under 10 minutes, the difference between all three is negligible.

---

## 02. Browser Automation

This is a dimension most comparison articles skip.

### Claude Code: ⭐⭐⭐

Has MCP mechanism but built-in browser capability is average. You need to configure a third-party MCP yourself.

**Real test**: Setting up a Playwright MCP took 30 minutes. Occasional issues during execution.

### Codex: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is Codex's **home turf**.

`mcp-server/browser_*` tools are natively supported: screenshots, clicks, form filling, scrolling — full service.

And anti-detection is solid. Won't get banned by websites.

**Real test**: Running Xiaohongshu automation — rock solid. Used it for 3 months without a single incident.

### Gemini: ⭐⭐⭐

Google's browser capability is mainly Chrome DevTools Protocol, good for technical debugging, not suited for daily automation.

**My take**: If you need browser automation (data scraping, auto-filling forms, batch operations), **just pick Codex**. Don't overthink it.

---

## 03. Tool Experience (Interaction Fluency)

### Claude Code: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Smoothest interaction. CLI experience closest to natural conversation.

Anthropic's signature elegance. Feels like a Michelin-starred restaurant — attentive service.

### Codex: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Fast, commands are concise. But interaction feels a bit more "mechanical."

Like fast food — fast and filling.

### Gemini: ⭐⭐⭐

Google's CLI is... hard to describe. Functionality is OK, but experience is a bit rough.

Like a company cafeteria — no expectations, but you'll be fed.

---

## 04. Fault Recovery (Resume from Breakpoint)

### Claude Code: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Supports checkpointing. Recovery mechanism is the most complete. Task interrupted mid-way? No problem, resume from the breakpoint.

**Real test**: Was running a refactoring task and the laptop ran out of power. Plugged it in, rebooted, and it resumed from the last saved state and completed the job.

### Codex: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Has basic recovery capability, but not as detailed as Claude.

### Gemini: ⭐⭐⭐

Recovery mechanism is relatively basic. Long tasks that get interrupted tend to fail.

---

## 05. Real Scenario Comparison

Talking about specs is boring. Let's go straight to scenarios.

### Scenario One: Xiaohongshu Operations Automation

| Tool | Experience |
|------|------------|
| Claude Code | Need to configure MCP yourself, took 30 min, occasional issues during execution |
| Codex | **Ready to use out of the box, stable, I use it every day** |
| Gemini | Not well-suited for this scenario |

**Conclusion**: For browser automation, **pick Codex**.

### Scenario Two: Complex Code Refactoring

| Tool | Experience |
|------|------------|
| Claude Code | Best context understanding, clear refactoring approach, high code quality |
| Codex | Fast, but refactoring quality slightly behind Claude |
| Gemini | Good for simple tasks, tends to go off-track on complex logic |

**Conclusion**: For complex refactoring, **pick Claude Code**.

### Scenario Three: Quick Script Writing

| Tool | Experience |
|------|------------|
| Claude Code | Too elegant for scripts, feels like using a sledgehammer |
| Codex | **Just right, concise commands, fast** |
| Gemini | Works, but experience is average |

**Conclusion**: For quick scripts, **pick Codex**.

## 06. Is It Possible to Have Everything?

Yes, brother.

I built RexCLI, an open-source workflow tool. The core idea: **don't reinvent the wheel — make existing Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini work together**.

### What problems does RexCLI solve?

**Problem 1: Losing context when switching tools**

Before: You were halfway through a task with Codex, wanted Claude to help optimize? Sorry, context is gone, start over.

RexCLI's Context DB remembers task progress. Switch tools without losing continuity.

**Problem 2: Browser automation configuration is a pain**

Every tool has different MCP configuration methods. Annoying?

RexCLI unifies `browser_*` tools. Whether you use Codex or Claude, you can operate browsers with the same commands.

**Problem 3: Secret key leak risk**

When running scripts, could your API key accidentally leak into logs?

RexCLI has Privacy Guard. Automatically redacts sensitive data before reading config files. Protects your keys.

### How to use it?

```bash
# Use Codex
codex

# Switch to Claude
claude

# Switch to Gemini
gemini
```

Context stays continuous throughout. Switch whenever you want.

## 07. Summary

| Your situation | Recommended |
|----------------|-------------|
| Writing core business code | Claude Code |
| Running automation scripts / browser operations | Codex |
| Google ecosystem developer | Gemini |
| Want the best of both worlds | RexCLI |

**My personal choice**: Daily scripts with Codex, complex code refactoring with Claude, Gemini for research when needed. Tools are a means, not an end.

---

## 08. Bonus

Honestly, for most developers, the three tools aren't that different.

**What truly affects efficiency is workflow continuity** — whether your task remembers where you left off, whether switching tools loses context.

From this angle, RexCLI may be the most complete solution available today.
